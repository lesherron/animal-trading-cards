# Animal Trading Card

First project that uses HTML to create a small project called Animal Trading Cards

## Overview

Tree frogs are fascinating amphibians that play an essential role in ecosystems. This card gives a bit of information about them.
## Species Highlighted

- **Proper Name**: Dryophytes Cinereus (American Green Tree Frog) / Hyla Cinera (Green Tree Frog)
- **Average Length**: 1.5 to 5 inches
- **Average Lifespan**: 2 - 5 years
- **Habitat**: Warm climate forests, grasslands, marshes, and other aquatic environments

## Unique Characteristics

Tree frogs are known for their unique "foam nests," created by frothing up secretions from their bodies to safeguard their eggs. These foam nests:
- Look like clusters of tiny bubbles, typically white or pale.
- Are formed by agitating air into a bodily secretion, creating a foamy substance.
- Play a crucial role in shielding developing eggs and embryos, offering a stable habitat that keeps predators at bay.
