			<p>Tree frogs are known for their unique "foam nests," created by frothing up secretions from their bodies to safeguard their eggs. these foam nests look like clusters of tiny bubbles and are typically white or pale. They produce these protective nests by agitating air into a bodily secretion, forming a foamy substance. These nests play a crucial role in shielding the developing eggs and embryos, offering a stable, habitat that also keeps predators at bay.</p>
